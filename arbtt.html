                <h2>What is arbtt?</h2>
                <p><b>arbtt</b> is a cross-platform, completely automatic time tracker.</p>
                <p>There are lots of time-tracking programs out there that allow you to
                collect statistics about how you spend your time,
                which activities are your biggest time-wasters, and so on.
                However, most of them require explicit action on your part:
                you have to manually enter what activity or project you're working on,
                and that has several disadvantages:

                </p><ul>
                    <li>You need to stop what you're doing to insert the meta-information, and that breaks your concentration;</li>
                    <li>If you are lazy or get annoyed and don't keep updating it, the statistics will be useless</li>
                    <li>You won't be able to catch a little thing like quickly answering an e-mail or looking for the weather report.</li>
                </ul>

                <p><b>arbtt</b>, on the other hand, is a time tracker that <i>gets out of the way</i>.
                Its core component (<code>arbtt-capture</code>) silently captures data
                about what you are doing, completely autonomously.
                No interaction required, no distraction possible.
                This information is continuously stored in a log file.
                A separate tool (<code>arbtt-stats</code>) the allows you to investigate this data,
                at whatever time is convenient to you, by using simple text-based rules.</p>

                <p>One big advantage of this approach is that you do not need to know in advance
                what queries you are interested in.
                Since the rules are applied in real-time when you are evaluating your data,
                and not when recording it, your raw data is always intact, and
                you can add more rules and forgotten special cases later.</p>

                <blockquote><i> Keep in mind that the log file might contain
                very sensitive private data. Make sure you protect it well.<br>
                You can get rid of all logs by deleting
                <code>~/.arbtt/capture.log</code></i>.</blockquote>

            <section id="how">
                <h2>How does it work?</h2>

                <p><code>arbtt-capture</code> is a desktop daemon that runs in the background
                and keeps a continuous log of your activity,
                by storing at regular intervals which windows are open,
                which one has the focus and how long it has been since your last action.</p>

                <p>From this log, a wealth of statistics can be derived.
                Here's where the "rule-based" part of the name comes along:
                arbtt comes with a built-in command-line statistics generator (<code>arbtt-stats</code>)
                that will, based on very simple but powerful rules you can customize,
                sift through the raw data and reveal patterns and relevant information.
                </p>
                <p>The rules are specified in a simple text-based format, on a file called
                "categorize.cfg". Here's an example of a simple categorize.cfg file:
                </p><pre>
--Convert program executable names to recognizable names
aliases (
  "Navigator"         -&gt; "Firefox",
  "evince"            -&gt; "PDF reader",
  "gedit"             -&gt; "Text editor",
  "totem"             -&gt; "Video player",
)

{
--Mark any samples captured after 5 minutes of inactivity with the "inactive" tag
$idle &gt; 300                     ==&gt; tag inactive,

--Tag each program with its executable name (filtered by the aliases above)
                                    tag Program:$current.program,

--Tag each program with its window title (filtered by the aliases above)
                                    tag Title:$current.title,

$time &gt;=  8:00 &amp;&amp; $time &lt; 12:00 ==&gt; tag time-of-day:morning,
$time &gt;= 14:00 &amp;&amp; $time &lt; 18:00 ==&gt; tag time-of-day:afternoon,
}</pre>

                <p>And here's the corresponding output of <code>arbtt-stats -c "Program"</code>:</p>
                <pre>

                  <h3>Binary installations</h3>
                    <li>
                        <b>Debian/Ubuntu:</b>
                        <p>arbtt is available both in
                        <a href="http://packages.debian.org/sid/arbtt">Debian's</a> and
                        <a href="http://packages.ubuntu.com/raring/arbtt">Ubuntu's</a> repositories.</p>
                        <p>Install arbtt:</p>
                        <code class="command">sudo apt-get install arbtt</code>
                        <p>Set it up to start automatically on system startup:</p>
                        <code class="command">cp /usr/share/doc/arbtt/examples/arbtt-capture.desktop ~/.config/autostart/</code>
                        <p>Start the daemon manually, if you want it to start capturing immediately,
                        rather than at the next system restart:</p>
                        <code class="command">(arbtt-capture &amp;)</code>
                        <p>Create a minimal categorize.cfg file to allow arbtt-stats to be invoked without errors:</p>
                        <code class="command">echo "{\$idle &gt; 60 ==&gt; tag inactive}" &gt; ~/.arbtt/categorize.cfg</code>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <b>Windows:</b><br>Download the
                        latest <a href="http://www.joachim-breitner.de/archive/arbtt/">arbtt-setup.exe</a>
                        and follow the setup process as usual. This will set up the capturing daemon,
                        but note that there is no graphical interface. Extracting stats from the data
                        requires running arbtt-stats on the command line. Run
                        <code>arbtt-stats --help</code> for a quick reference;
                        for more detailed information, consult the
                        <a href="doc/users_guide/arbtt-stats.html">manual</a>.
                    </li>
                    <h3>Source installations</h3>

                      <p>arbtt can be installed from source either via cabal install or from the source repository.</p>
                      <b>Dependencies:</b>
                      <p>arbtt depends on several libraries whose development versions (name often suffixed <code>-dev</code>) must be available or the compilation
                        may fail with errors such as <code>X11-1.6.1.2 failed during the configure step</code>;
                        these libraries include:
                        <ul>
                          <li>X11, for the X11 Haskell binding (possibly named <code>libx11-dev</code> or <code>xorg-dev</code> in your package manager)</li>
                          <li>PCRE3, for pcre-light (possibly <code>libpcre3-dev</code>)</li>
                          <li>XSS, for arbtt (possibly <code>libxss-dev</code>)</li>
                        </ul>
                      </p>
                    <li>
                      <b>From Hackage:</b>
                      <p>arbtt has been <a href="http://hackage.haskell.org/package/arbtt">published on hackage</a>,
                        the Haskell package database. If you have
                        <a href="http://www.haskell.org/haskellwiki/Cabal-Install">cabal-install</a>
                        available, you can install arbtt by simply running:</p>
                        <code class="command">cabal install arbtt</code>
                    </li>

                    <li>
                        <b>Build from repo:</b>
                        <p>Download the latest release from <a href="http://www.joachim-breitner.de/archive/arbtt/">the archive</a>.
                        Extract the tarball and run the following commands to build and install the arbtt binaries:</p>
                        <code class="command">runhaskell Setup.hs configure</code><br>
                        <code class="command">runhaskell Setup.hs build</code><br>
                        <code class="command">runhaskell Setup.hs install</code><br>
                        <p>If you use GNOME or KDE, you can copy the file "arbtt-capture.desktop"
                        to ~/.config/autostart/. If you didn't do a system-wide installation,
                        you'll probably need to put the full path to arbtt-capture
                        in the Exec line of the .desktop file.</p>
                    </li>

                    <li>
                        <b>Mac OS X support:</b>
                        <p>arbtt can run on Mac OS X systems. To compile it, you need to install the pkgconfig and pcre source packages
                        using <a href="http://brew.sh">Homebrew</a> or <a href="https://www.macports.org">MacPorts</a>. For Homebrew, you can execute:</p>
                        <code class="command">brew install pkgconfig</code><br>
                        <code class="command">brew install pcre</code><br>
                        <p>or for MacPorts:</p>
                        <code class="command">sudo port install pkgconfig</code><br>
                        <code class="command">sudo port install pcre</code><br>
                        <p>Then, you can compile arbtt using the usual cabal commands.</p>
                        <p>If you use MacPorts and have a linking error, it may be because of a conflict between the system libiconv and the MacPorts libiconv.
                        Execute the following cabal command to resolve the conflict:</p>
                        <code class="command">cabal configure --extra-lib-dir=/usr/lib</code><br>
                        <p>When the installation is done, your arbtt binaries will be located in <code>~/Library/Haskell/bin</code> or <code>~/.cabal/bin</code>.</p>
                    </li>
                </ul>
