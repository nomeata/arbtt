-- This defines some aliases, to make the reports look nicer:
aliases (
  "sun-awt-X11-XFramePeer"  -> "java",
  "sun-awt-X11-XDialogPeer" -> "java",
  "sun-awt-X11-XWindowPeer" -> "java",
  )

-- A rule that probably everybody wants. Being inactive for over a minute
-- causes this sample to be ignored by default.
$idle > 60 ==> tag inactive,

-- Simple rule that just tags the current program
tag Program:$current.program,

-- To be able to match on the time of day, I introduce tags for that as well
$time >=  2:00 && $time <  8:00 ==> tag time-of-day:night,
$time >=  8:00 && $time < 12:00 ==> tag time-of-day:morning,
$time >= 12:00 && $time < 14:00 ==> tag time-of-day:lunchtime,
$time >= 14:00 && $time < 18:00 ==> tag time-of-day:afternoon,
$time >= 18:00 && $time < 22:00 ==> tag time-of-day:evening,
$time >= 22:00 || $time <  2:00 ==> tag time-of-day:late-evening,

-- This tag always refers to the last 24h
$sampleage <= 24:00 ==> tag last-day,

let night = $time >=  2:00 && $time <  8:00,

current window $program == "emacs" && $night ==> tag night-coding
